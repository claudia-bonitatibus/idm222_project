Reflection on previous design:
For my project I will be redesigning and building upon my portfolio website. As far as the content goes I am in a good place as I move forward with the design process. My main concern is that last quarter I ran into an error with my custom fonts and some of my formatting which was that, even on computers that hadn't visited my website before, the cache had to be cleared before the cotent would be displayed as intended. While there are many changes that I will make regarding the layout and responsiveness of the design I am happy with the overall tone and color palette that I have previously established.


To do list:
	•	Look over html documents from last term and assess what needs to be adjusted
	•	Make sure that custom fonts and all layout functions properly 
	•	Start implementing responsive design in a new styles sheet
	•	Find and implement a more engaging way of displaying my resume which requires less 
		scrolling
	•	Consider accumulating more assets high quality to fill out the college portfolio
