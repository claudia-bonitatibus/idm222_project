  <h2> Wood Nymph Mask </h2>
  <p> Created in the Fall of 2013</p>
  <p> This paper mache mask was made to depict different components of my identity, both internal and external. Writing about the traits that are being depicted is physically incorporated into the mask itself. The paper with the visual traits is used as hair, while the personality traits that are not vissible are on the inside of the mask.</p>
  <p> This mask is made out of strips of newspaper which were assembled using a glue-like mixture. The mask was then painted using acrylic paints and the writing was incorporated on strips of printed paper which was stained with coffee to give them a more aged, natural appearance.</p>
