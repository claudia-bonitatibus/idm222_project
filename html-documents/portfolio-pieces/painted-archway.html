  <div class="imageDescription">
    <p> Created in the Fall of 2017</p>
    <p> This painting depicts Via Giulia in Rome, Italy. It is one of many pieces that were painted during a study abroad trip covering Interior and Architectural Design. </p>
    <p> The painting started as a pencil sketch to accurately capture the perspective of the scene and the color was added later using a acquarella style of watercoloring.</p>
