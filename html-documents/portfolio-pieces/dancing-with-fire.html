 <h2> Dancing With Fire </h2>
  <p> Created in the Summer of 2015</p>
  <p> This piece was designed to show how several seperate photos can be joined into one composition. The numerous layers with various levels of opacity bring a subtle richness to the final design and contribute to there being a different narrative in the final design than there were in the original photographs.</p>
  <p> The photographs were taken with a DSLR camera, edited in Adobe Lightroom, and overlayed in Photoshop.</p>
