  <div class="imageDescription">
    <p> Created in the Winter of 2014</p>
    <p> This illustration was created to accompany a short story which was written by a fellow student. The piece was designed to be an atmospheric and soft addition so that it could add to, instead of distract from, the existing content.</p>
    <p> The illustration was made using chalk pastels, which gave the composition a softer and more mystical tone. This contributed to giving it an atmospheric, yet undefined appearance.</p>
